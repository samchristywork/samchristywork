# Contributing

<i>TL;DR: Please don't submit contributions. It isn't that I don't appreciate
them; it's just not the purpose of this repository.</i>

This project is a creation of my public, professional GitHub account. I
maintain this account solely for the convenience of professional contacts that
need some proof of my coding abilities to hire or work on contracts.
Contributions from others, while valuable for learning purposes and the
development of the projects themselves, are counter to the purpose of this
account.

If you see a problem with my code that is absolutely dire, you may create an
issue, or if you have my contact information, you can notify me of the problem
that way. I will not approve pull requests, and I respectfully ask that you
don't contribute in other ways, such as watching, forking, or starring the
repositories.

Thank you,
Sam
